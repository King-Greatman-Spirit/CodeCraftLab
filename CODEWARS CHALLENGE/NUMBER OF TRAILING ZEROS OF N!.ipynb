    "## Breakdown of the above solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course! Let me break down the solution for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, trailing zeros in the factorial of a number depend on the number of factors of 10 in the factorial. Since 10 can be expressed as 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in the factorial of any integer greater than 4, counting the factors of 5 in the factorial gives us the number of trailing zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Count**: We start by initializing a variable `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of trailing zeros in the factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Count Factors of 5**: We use a `while` loop to continuously divide the given number `n` by powers of 5. At each iteration, we divide `n` by 5 and add the quotient to the `count`. This is because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5 to the factorial, and every multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Count**: Once we have divided `n` by all the powers of 5 until it becomes less than 5, we return the final count, which represents the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of the given number `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For `n = 12`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first iteration: `12 // 5 = 2`, so `count = 2`.\n",
    "- In the second iteration: `2 // 5 = 0`, so no further counts are added.\n",
    "- Finally, `count` becomes `2`, indicating that `12!` has 2 trailing zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient because it only requires a few iterations to count the factors of 5 in the factorial, rather than actually computing the factorial itself, which can lead to overflow for large values of `n`."
